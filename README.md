# General git repository/GitLab project structure

In order to easily navigate through all repositories, each of them should try to adhere to the following top-level structure, if possible:

Directories in the project root (top-level directory):

- **3rdparty**: External libs/dependencies of the project
- **contrib**: Contains various utility scripts
- **doc**: Documentation related stuff
- **src**: Contains the source code files of the project (e.g.Â .h/.cpp/.py files)
- **tests**: The code for the unit/integration tests of the project
    - **tests/integration_tests**: This is the place to put integration tests.
